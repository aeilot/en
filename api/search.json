Due to poor skill and the lack of experience, grammartical mistakes might be made. Be free to point them out!\n\n\nI come to my hometown to play. The weather there isn’t very dry. It often rains though in winter.\nIt’s a rainy day today. It smells like something fresh in spring – the earth. And my sneakers are sopping. It’s raining gently outside and the sky is still bright. I love rainy days. They’re blissful days when the plants are sucking the raindrops falling from above the vast plains in the sky. I always stay inside my wooden cottage and do nothing but staring outside. I enjoy the rain. The raindrops hit the roof of my barn and makes me happy. It is as if playing a pop song.\nHowever, rain brings trouble as well. I feel isolated from the outside world, especially my friends that are awaiting me to play. I hear the wind weeping when I think of not being able to go outdoors, although my pet spaniel keeps me company.\nNevertheless, it’s not too bad since the rain comes with solitude. Often do I read books inside by the fireplace. This feeling is wonderful.\nI don’t know whether rainy days are happy days or lonely days. Anyway, I love these days.\n","slug":"the-rain","date":"2022-01-21T22:45:09.000Z","categories_index":"Essay","tags_index":"","author_index":"Louis Aeilot"},{"id":"73203d152e73e495e8b03d669741c9bb","title":"sudo shutdown -r now","content":"You may be puzzled that all the blog posts are gone. This is because I had my blog cleaned up a few days ago.\ntl;dr\nThe other day, I suddenly found that my blog was occupied by articles that are not helpful at all. Seeing these, I was determined to restart my blog. It was so great a feeling. The _posts directory empty, I got relieved.\nBefore this, my posts are either “stolen” from the others or just full of nonsense. Here, I am committed to not making such an unforgivable thing happen any longer. After all, the blog was completely built by myself — the about page, the configuration of the theme, the font, etc. were all made through effort. I had modified the theme a lot, adjusting the blog to be good-looking. And what about the result? Filled with trash!!! lol. What on earth am I doing!!!\nSo, where the past blog posts? Actually, I did not really delete them. I just placed them in the Draft directory. Of course, you are inaccessible to them. lol.\nLet’s get to know each other again. Run the code sudo shutdown -r now!\n","slug":"hello-world","date":"2020-07-21T22:45:09.000Z","categories_index":"Essay","tags_index":"","author_index":"Louis Aeilot"}]
