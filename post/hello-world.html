<span id="more"></span>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>The other day, I suddenly found that my blog was occupied by articles that are not helpful at all. Seeing these, I was determined to restart my blog. It was so great a feeling. The <code>_posts</code> directory empty, I got relieved.</p>
<p>Before this, my posts are either “stolen” from the others or just full of nonsense. Here, I am committed to not making such an unforgivable thing happen any longer. After all, the blog was completely built by myself — the about page, the configuration of the theme, the font, etc. were all made through effort. I had modified the theme a lot, adjusting the blog to be good-looking. And what about the result? Filled with trash!!! lol. What on earth am I doing!!!</p>
<p>So, where the past blog posts? Actually, I did not really delete them. I just placed them in the Draft directory. Of course, you are inaccessible to them. lol.</p>
<p>Let’s get to know each other again. Run the code <code>sudo shutdown -r</code> now!</p>
