<p>I come to my hometown to play. The weather there isn’t very dry. It often rains though in winter.</p>
<p>It’s a rainy day today. It smells like something fresh in spring – the earth. And my sneakers are sopping. It’s raining gently outside and the sky is still bright. I love rainy days. They’re blissful days when the plants are sucking the raindrops falling from above the vast plains in the sky. I always stay inside my wooden cottage and do nothing but staring outside. I enjoy the rain. The raindrops hit the roof of my barn and makes me happy. It is as if playing a pop song.</p>
<p>However, rain brings trouble as well. I feel isolated from the outside world, especially my friends that are awaiting me to play. I hear the wind weeping when I think of not being able to go outdoors, although my pet spaniel keeps me company.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s not too bad since the rain comes with solitude. Often do I read books inside by the fireplace. This feeling is wonderful.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether rainy days are happy days or lonely days. Anyway, I love these days.</p>
